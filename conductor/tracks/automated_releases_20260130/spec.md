# Specification - Automated GitHub Releases with Gemini Summaries

## Overview
This track implements a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the creation of GitHub releases whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository. The workflow will use the `run-gemini-cli` action to generate a draft release summary that utilizes emoji shortcodes for categorization and clarity.

## Functional Requirements
- **Release Trigger:** The workflow must trigger on every `push` of a new `tag`.
- **Summary Generation:** Use `google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli` to analyze recent commits and generate a release summary.
- **Emoji Usage:** The summary must use emoji shortcodes (e.g., :sparkles:, :bug:) to categorize changes (Features, Fixes, Chores, etc.).
- **Draft Status:** All created releases must be set to `draft: true`.
- **Content Strategy:** The Gemini-generated summary will serve as the entire body of the release.
- **Model Selection:** Use `gemini-1.5-pro` for generating the summary.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Ensure that the `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for the action) is stored as a GitHub Secret and not exposed.
- **Reliability:** The workflow should handle cases where there are no new commits since the last tag gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A new workflow file `.github/workflows/release.yml` exists.
- [ ] Pushing a new tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`) triggers the workflow.
- [ ] A draft release is created on GitHub.
- [ ] The release body contains a summary generated by Gemini with appropriate emoji shortcodes.

## Out of Scope
- Automatic publishing of the release (it must remain a draft for manual review).
- Integration with external issue trackers (other than standard GitHub issue linking).
