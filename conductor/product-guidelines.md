# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Minimalist Design:** Prioritize clarity and readability, leveraging the strengths of the E-ink display. Avoid clutter and excessive decoration.
- **Typography:** Use readable sans-serif or serif fonts available on the TRMNL device. Ensure sufficient contrast and spacing between the quote text and the author attribution.
- **Layout Consistency:** Ensure the content adapts gracefully across all supported layouts (Full, Half Horizontal, Half Vertical, Quadrant), maintaining visual balance.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Zero Friction:** The configuration should be "set and forget." Once linked to a Google Sheet, the plugin should operate autonomously.
- **Error Handling:** If a quote cannot be fetched or a column is missing, display a polite and clear fallback message (e.g., "Time for a refill...") rather than a raw error code.
- **Data Privacy:** Respect user privacy by only accessing the specific spreadsheet provided.

## Tone and Voice
- **Calm & Reflective:** The presentation of quotes should feel serene and unobtrusive, fitting for an ambient display.
- **Direct:** Configuration labels and instructions should be straightforward and devoid of technical jargon where possible.
