# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Implementation:**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to satisfy the task's requirements.
   - For TRMNL plugins, this involves editing `.liquid` and `.yml` files.

4. **Verify Locally:**
   - Since there is no local dev server, verification involves manual inspection of the liquid templates and ensuring they follow the TRMNL structure.

5. **Mark Task Complete in Plan:**
   - Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, and update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`.

6. **Documentation:** Update `product.md` or `tech-stack.md` if any architectural or product-level decisions were made during the task.

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1. **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2. **List Changed Files:** Execute `git status` to see all files modified during this phase.

3. **Verify and Create Tests:**
   - TRMNL plugins typically use Liquid. If a testing framework is introduced (e.g., for liquid rendering), ensure tests are updated.
   - Target: >80% coverage if applicable.

4. **Execute Automated Tests (if any):**
   - Run `npm test` or the identified test command.
   - If tests fail, inform the user and begin debugging.

5. **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
   - Generate a step-by-step plan for the user to verify the phase's goals within the TRMNL environment.

6. **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
   - **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

7. **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
   - Stage all changes for the entire phase, including code and `plan.md`.
   - Perform a single commit for the phase (e.g., `feat: Complete Phase 1 - Core Layouts`).

8. **Attach Phase Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 8.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the checkpoint commit.
   - **Step 8.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed phase, listing all tasks finished and the overall impact.
   - **Step 8.3: Attach Note:** Use `git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>`.

9. **Record Phase Checkpoint SHA in Plan:**
   - Update `plan.md` to record the SHA next to the phase heading.

10. **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created.

### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented (e.g., docstrings, JSDoc, GoDoc)
- [ ] Type safety is enforced (e.g., type hints, TypeScript types, Go types)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors (using the project's configured tools)
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Development & Usage

### "Building"
There is no compilation step. The source code *is* the distribution.
To "deploy" or "install":
1.  The `src/` directory is the plugin bundle.
2.  In a standard TRMNL development setup, this folder would be copied to the user's plugins directory.

### Running/Testing
*   **Local Testing:** Since this relies on the TRMNL environment to parse `settings.yml` and render `.liquid` with the fetched data, local testing typically requires a TRMNL simulator or uploading the plugin to a private TRMNL account.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  TRMNL reads `settings.yml`.
    2.  It constructs the polling URL using the user-provided `spreadsheet_id`.
    3.  It fetches the CSV data.
    4.  It passes the data to the `.liquid` templates to render the image.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Every module must have corresponding tests.
- Use appropriate test setup/teardown mechanisms (e.g., fixtures, beforeEach/afterEach).
- Mock external dependencies.
- Test both success and failure cases.

### Integration Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Verify database transactions
- Test authentication and authorization
- Check form submissions

### Mobile Testing
- Test on actual iPhone when possible
- Use Safari developer tools
- Test touch interactions
- Verify responsive layouts
- Check performance on 3G/4G

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add remember me functionality"
git commit -m "fix(posts): Correct excerpt generation for short posts"
git commit -m "test(comments): Add tests for emoji reaction limits"
git commit -m "style(mobile): Improve button touch targets"
```
